# What is this?

Geography game(s) I built with two aims:

① Learn Vue.

② Build a free copy of the annoyingly addictive <a href ="https://www.geoguessr.com/">Geoguesser</a> so that I didn't have to pay for the full version of the original.

Play the game <a href="https://geography-geeks.netlify.app">here</a>!
